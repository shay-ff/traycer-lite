# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a web application that serves as an intelligent planning layer for coding agents. The application accepts code context and user intent, generates structured implementation plans via LLM, allows users to edit and reorder plan steps, and then executes each step to produce code changes with diffs for review. The system bridges the gap between high-level user requests and actionable code modifications by breaking down complex tasks into manageable, sequential steps.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to input existing code context and describe my intent, so that I can get a structured plan for implementing my changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the application THEN the system SHALL display input fields for code context and user intent
2. WHEN a user provides code context (optional) and user intent (required) THEN the system SHALL validate that intent is not empty
3. WHEN a user clicks "Generate Plan" THEN the system SHALL send the inputs to the Groq API with a structured prompt
4. WHEN the Groq API returns a response THEN the system SHALL parse the JSON response into a Plan object with task, language, file, and steps properties
5. IF the API response is invalid JSON THEN the system SHALL display an error message and allow retry

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to edit and reorder the generated plan steps, so that I can customize the implementation approach before execution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a plan is generated THEN the system SHALL display each step as an editable card with title, description, and metadata
2. WHEN a user clicks on a step's title or description THEN the system SHALL allow inline editing of that content
3. WHEN a user drags a step card THEN the system SHALL allow reordering of steps with visual feedback
4. WHEN a user saves changes to a step THEN the system SHALL update the plan data structure immediately
5. WHEN a user deletes a step THEN the system SHALL remove it from the plan and update step IDs accordingly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to execute individual plan steps and see the generated code changes, so that I can review and apply modifications incrementally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Run Step" on any step THEN the system SHALL send the step details and code context to the Groq API
2. WHEN the step execution API returns a response THEN the system SHALL parse the JSON into a StepExecution object with patch and explanation
3. WHEN a patch is received THEN the system SHALL display it in a diff viewer with syntax highlighting
4. WHEN a patch format is "unified_diff" THEN the system SHALL render it as a git-style diff
5. WHEN a patch format is "full_file" THEN the system SHALL display the complete file replacement
6. IF step execution fails THEN the system SHALL display the error and allow retry

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to review, accept, and export the generated code changes, so that I can apply them to my actual codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a generated patch THEN the system SHALL provide "Accept Patch", "Copy Code", and "Regenerate" buttons
2. WHEN a user clicks "Copy Code" THEN the system SHALL copy the patch content to the clipboard
3. WHEN a user clicks "Accept Patch" THEN the system SHALL mark the step as accepted and move to the next step
4. WHEN all steps are completed THEN the system SHALL provide an "Export Patch" button
5. WHEN a user clicks "Export Patch" THEN the system SHALL generate and download a .patch file containing all accepted changes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to handle API communication reliably, so that I can trust the plan generation and execution process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making API calls to Groq THEN the system SHALL include proper error handling and timeout management
2. WHEN API calls fail due to network issues THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages and retry options
3. WHEN API responses are malformed THEN the system SHALL validate JSON structure and provide meaningful error feedback
4. WHEN API rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL display rate limit information and suggested wait times
5. WHEN the system processes LLM responses THEN it SHALL sanitize and validate all content before rendering

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a responsive and intuitive user interface, so that I can efficiently work with plans and code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a clean, organized interface with clearly labeled sections
2. WHEN working with large code contexts THEN the system SHALL provide syntax highlighting and proper formatting
3. WHEN viewing diffs THEN the system SHALL highlight additions, deletions, and unchanged lines with distinct colors
4. WHEN the interface is used on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL maintain usability and readability
5. WHEN performing drag-and-drop operations THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback and smooth animations

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to deploy the application to a production environment, so that I can share it with others and use it from anywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to Vercel THEN the system SHALL build successfully without errors
2. WHEN environment variables are configured THEN the system SHALL securely handle API keys without exposing them in client-side code
3. WHEN the application is accessed in production THEN it SHALL maintain all functionality including API communication
4. WHEN the deployed app receives traffic THEN it SHALL handle concurrent users and API requests efficiently
5. WHEN the deployment is updated THEN the system SHALL maintain zero-downtime deployment practices

#### Production Configuration

1. Environment Variables Required:
   - `GROQ_API_KEY`: Groq API authentication key
   - `GROQ_MODEL`: LLM model identifier (llama-3.3-70b-versatile)
   - `GROQ_MAX_TOKENS`: Maximum response tokens (4096)
   - `GROQ_TEMPERATURE`: Generation creativity (0.1)

2. Security Considerations:
   - API keys stored securely in deployment platform
   - HTTPS enforced for all communications
   - Client-side validation with server-side sanitization
   - Rate limiting on API endpoints

3. Performance Requirements:
   - Initial page load < 2 seconds
   - API response times < 30 seconds for plan generation
   - Responsive design for mobile and desktop
   - Optimized bundle size and code splitting
